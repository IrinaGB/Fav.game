     <p class="text"> This is a brief introduction to WORLD OF WARCRAFT 3  high fantasy real-time strategy computer video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment & released in July 2002. </p>
     <p class="text1">Warcraft III features four playable factions: The Human Alliance — a coalition of humans, dwarves, and high elves — and the Orcish Horde — composed of orcs, trolls, and minotaur-inspired tauren — return from the previous games while the Undead Scourge and the Night Elves were added as two new factions.As in StarCraft, each race has a unique set of units, structures, technologies, and base-building methodology </p>
   <p class="text2">Warcraft III takes place on a map of varying size, such as large plains and fields, with terrain features like rivers, mountains, seas, or cliffs. The map is initially hidden from view and only becomes visible through exploration. Areas no longer in sight range of an allied unit or building are covered with the fog of war, meaning that while the terrain remains visible, changes such as enemy troop movements and building construction are not.</p>
   <p class="text3">During a game, players must establish settlements to gain resources, defend against others, and train units to explore the map and fight computer controlled foes.There are three main resources that are managed in Warcraft III: gold, lumber, and food.The first two are required to construct units and buildings, while food restricts the maximum number of units that can be possessed at the same time.Additionally, a new "upkeep" system means that producing units over certain amounts will decrease the amount of gold one can earn, compelling players to focus on playing with a limited number of units to avoid penalties</p>
